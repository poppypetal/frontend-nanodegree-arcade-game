This game is not live online.  To play, please visit the folder 'fontend-nanodegree-arcade-game' on my github account:
https://github.com/poppypetal/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

From here you can fork my repository, clone in desktop or download a zip file.  Once you have the file on your computer, you may have to unzip the files first or simply navigate to where you saved the folder and open up index.html in your browser to begin playing.

Game Goal:
Cross the game board without hitting any of the enemies.

How to play:

To move: the up arrow moves player up on the board, the left arrow moves player left, the right arrow moves player right and the down arrow moves player down.  

If the player reaches the edge of the board, the player will reset to the starting position.  

If the player collides with the enemy, the player will be reset to start.  

Open up the console; if the player reaches the water, the console will display "Good Job! Score: #" and if the player collides with a bug, the console will display "Oops, you hit a bug!"

Hope you enjoy playing, good luck!
